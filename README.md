### Introduction

Understanding algorithms and data structures is crucial for creating effective and optimized software solutions. This repository aims to provide a collection of well-implemented algorithms and data structures, with detailed explanations and examples. It is a resource for both novice and experienced programmers who want to expand their knowledge and problem-solving skills.

### Algorithms

The "Algorithms" directory contains implementations of various algorithms, including sorting, searching, graphing, and many others. Each algorithm is documented with explanations of its time complexity and usage scenarios.

### Data structures

The DataStructures directory contains implementations of basic data structures such as arrays, link lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each data structure is described with a full explanation of its properties, operations and use cases.

### Instruction

We invite you to familiarize yourself with the code in this repository and use it for educational purposes, programming training or as a source of information for your own projects. Each algorithm and data structure is delivered as a separate file or module, making it easy to integrate into your own project. Just go to the appropriate directory and select your preferred programming language.

### Co-creation

Any contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes or new algorithms/data structures to add, feel free to submit a change request. Please respect the established coding style and provide clear documentation for the changes you make.

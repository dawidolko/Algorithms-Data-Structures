# Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to the Algorithms-Data-Structures repository, where we dive into the fundamental elements that are critical for tackling complex computational problems and enhancing the performance of software applications. This repository serves as a public resource for anyone interested in learning more about the theoretical and practical aspects of algorithms and data structures.

## Overview

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive guide and reference for students, educators, and software developers. It encompasses a wide array of algorithms and data structures, meticulously coded, documented, and provided with examples to illustrate their use and functionality.

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. The algorithms included in this repository are categorized based on their type and the nature of problems they solve. Here, you will find everything from simple sorting and searching algorithms to more complex cryptographic and graph algorithms.

### Featured Algorithms Categories

- **Sorting**: Including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and more.
- **Searching**: Such as Binary Search, Linear Search, and Search Trees.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Including Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Pathfinding, Bellman-Ford, and others for graph traversal and shortest path finding.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Algorithms like Knapsack Problem, Fibonacci Sequence, and more that solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Cryptography**: Basic implementation of algorithms used for encryption and decryption.

Each algorithm comes with its own separate README detailing the approach, complexity, and use cases.

## Data Structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are critical to the design of efficient algorithms.

### Featured Data Structures

- **Linear Data Structures**: Such as Arrays, Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
- **Tree Structures**: Including Binary Trees, AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees.
- **Hash Structures**: Hash Maps, Hash Sets, and more.
- **Graph Structures**: Representations of graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.

Each data structure is provided with implementation examples and a description of its properties, including time complexity.
